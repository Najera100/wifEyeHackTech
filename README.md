# wifEyeHackTech

My team has been frustrated for quite some time now by the lack of transparency in how companies interact with our computers, and so for this hackathon we set out to create a web app that demystifies the technical jargon stored in our computers. Using the Twlio API, Node.js, and Microsoft Azure, we created Wif-Eye, a web app that provides subscribers with cookie tracking. With easy-to-understand UI and a responsive alert system set up to notify users of any breach in privacy, this app provides absolute cookie transparency.
